# hello-world
Hello there! I'm an eager learner, and now it's the time to learn github. I have used it in the past to report bugs and follow some open source projects, but I was never an active user. Now that I'm learning web dev too, I noticed that I will be an active user of this platform in the close future and better sooner than later to learn it.
